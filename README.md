A Mobile App usage tracker that stores its data using online API connected to a MySQL database in order to work cross platform.


## Information

I originally made this as my final project to graduate from highschool. This project was very rushed, though this version, this Mobile version should be fully functional but there are definitely still some bugs, it is not fully tested and it has a bunch of weird quirks that I would fix if I wasn't working on a rewrite already.

Although it is functional, it is not well designed as I focused exclusively on programming the required features.

The API used to be hosted for free on Heroku but they currently do not offer the free tier anymore so the API is therefore offline. The MySQL database hosting itself was provided by my highschool which I now graduated from and is therefore also offline.

## Rewrite

I'm currently working on a complete rewrite of the project since I do believe this project had a lot of potential that it has not yet reached. It will be a very different tech stack so this repository will therefore not be updated but I will link the new project once I have a public repository for it.


## Disclaimer

This program is written using XAMARIN forms which would imply that there is both a Android and iOS version. 

When I started working on this project, I wanted to make the Android version in Android Studio, but later on I realised I did not have the time to make both an Android and iOS version seperately since I had next to no experience with Java app development.

 I did however want to make both since I used an iPhone at the time (and still do as of writing this). Sadly I did not own a desktop running MacOS (I spent hours trying to build a Mac VM but it did not want to install the newest version of XCode), 

I currently do own a Mac Mini since I bought one to compile the code for the rewrite but the functional code for Android and iOS are completely different and since I couldn't test the app on iPhone, I never ended up being able to write the iOS Code.

**TLDR: THIS APP IS ONLY FOR ANDROID SINCE I DID NOT OWN A MAC TO COMPILE THE IOS CODE**
